# Project_2
## Asteroids - NeoWs
#### User : General Public

#### Context:
NeoWs (Near Earth Object Web Service) is a RESTful web service for near earth Asteroid information. With NeoWs a user can: search for Asteroids based on their closest approach date to Earth, lookup a specific Asteroid with its NASA JPL small body id, as well as browse the overall data-set.

#### Experience:
Simple graphic indicating newr earch orbiting objects, with attatched attributes like Radious, Dates....etc) 

Data-set: All the data is from the NASA JPL Asteroid team (http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/).

#### Potential obstacles:
The file structure contains only single astroid, with different files linkings to different astroids, I am not sure how complicated incorporating multiple api in of would be or if its even possible. 

#### Inspriation: [[OpenFrameworks] Data Visualization with ofxJSON](https://vimeo.com/110925630)
